## Project Overview

This project primarily features a stop loss/take profit generator capable of determining the optimal parameters for your TradingView strategy. Additionally, it incorporates machine learning algorithms, using sklearn, to hyper-optimize your TradingView strategy. The project includes a comprehensive range of ratios, such as Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Information, Treynor, and Max Profit, providing a multifaceted approach to strategy optimization. Another key feature is the next-day closing price predictor, a script that empowers you to forecast the following day's closing price accurately. Please refer to the machine learning directory to access the stored pictures or examine the comments in the source code for a clearer understanding. To ensure user-friendliness and accessibility for traders of all expertise levels, the project includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
